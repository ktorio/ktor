/* Conventions:

   All functions prefixed with u8_ operate on UTF-8 encoded strings.
   Their unit is an uint8_t (1 byte).

   All functions prefixed with u16_ operate on UTF-16 encoded strings.
   Their unit is an uint16_t (a 2-byte word).

   All functions prefixed with u32_ operate on UCS-4 encoded strings.
   Their unit is an uint32_t (a 4-byte word).

   All argument pairs (s, n) denote a Unicode string s[0..n-1] with exactly
   n units.

   Functions returning a string result take a (resultbuf, lengthp) argument
   pair.  If resultbuf is not NULL and the result fits into *lengthp units,
   it is put in resultbuf, and resultbuf is returned.  Otherwise, a freshly
   allocated string is returned.  In both cases, *lengthp is set to the
   length (number of units) of the returned string.  In case of error,
   NULL is returned and errno is set.  */
