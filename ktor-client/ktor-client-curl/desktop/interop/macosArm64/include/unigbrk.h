   points A and B.  A "grapheme cluster" is an approximation to a
   user-perceived character, which sometimes corresponds to multiple code
   points.  For example, an English letter followed by an acute accent can be
   expressed as two consecutive Unicode code points, but it is perceived by the
   user as only a single character and therefore constitutes a single grapheme
   cluster.

   Implements extended (not legacy) grapheme cluster rules, because UAX #29
   indicates that they are preferred.

   Note: This function does not work right with syllables in Indic scripts or
   emojis, because it does not look at the characters before A and after B.
