/**
 * Represents a prepared HTTP request statement for [HttpClient].
 *
 * The [HttpStatement] class encapsulates a request configuration without executing it immediately.
 * This statement can be executed on-demand via various methods such as [execute], allowing for
 * deferred or multiple executions without creating a new request each time.
 *
 * ## Deferred Execution
 * `HttpStatement` does not initiate any network activity until an execution method is called.
 * It is safe to execute multiple times, which can be useful in scenarios requiring reusability of
 * the same request configuration.
 *
 * Example: [Streaming data](https://ktor.io/docs/response.html#streaming)
 *
 * [Report a problem](https://ktor.io/feedback/?fqname=io.ktor.client.statement.HttpStatement)

     * Executes the HTTP statement and processes the response of type [T] through the provided [block].
     *
     * This function is particularly useful for handling streaming responses, allowing you to process data on-the-fly

     * The [block] receives the streamed [response] and can be used to perform operations on the data as it arrives.
     *
     * Once [block] completes, the resources associated with the response are automatically cleaned up, freeing
     * any network or memory resources held by the response.

     * ## Usage Example
     * ```
     * client.request {
     *     url("https://ktor.io")
     * }.body<ByteReadChannel> { channel ->
     *     // Process streaming data here
