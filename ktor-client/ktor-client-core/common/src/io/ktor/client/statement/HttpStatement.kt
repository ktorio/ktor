/**
 * Represents a prepared HTTP request statement for [HttpClient].
 *
 * The [HttpStatement] class encapsulates a request configuration without executing it immediately.
 * This statement can be executed on-demand via various methods such as [execute], allowing for
 * deferred or multiple executions without creating a new request each time.
 *
 * ## Deferred Execution
 * `HttpStatement` does not initiate any network activity until an execution method is called.
 * It is safe to execute multiple times, which can be useful in scenarios requiring reusability of
 * the same request configuration.
 *
 * Example: [Streaming data](https://ktor.io/docs/response.html#streaming)

     * Executes the HTTP statement and processes the response of type [T] through the provided [block].
     *
     * This function is particularly useful for handling streaming responses, allowing you to process data on-the-fly
     * while the network connection remains open.
     * The [block] receives the streamed [response] and can be used to perform operations on the data as it arrives.
     *
     * Once [block] completes, the resources associated with the response are automatically cleaned up, freeing
     * any network or memory resources held by the response.
     *
     * ## Usage Example
     * ```
     * client.request {
     *     url("https://ktor.io")
     * }.body<ByteReadChannel> { channel ->
     *     // Process streaming data here
     * }
     * // Resources are released automatically after block completes
     * ```
     *
     * @param block A suspend function that handles the streamed [response] of type [T].
     * @return The result of [block] applied to the streaming [response].
     *
     * @note For streaming types (such as [ByteReadChannel]), ensure processing completes within [block], as resources
     * will be cleaned up automatically once [block] finishes.
