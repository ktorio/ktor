/**
 * Represents a capability that an [HttpClientEngine] can support, with [T] representing the type
 * of configuration or metadata associated with the capability.
 *
 * Capabilities are used to declare optional features or behaviors that an engine may support,
 * such as WebSocket communication, HTTP/2, or custom timeouts. They enable plugins and request
 * builders to configure engine-specific functionality by associating a capability with a
 * specific configuration.
 *
 * Capabilities can be set on a per-request basis using the `HttpRequestBuilder.setCapability` method,
 * allowing users to configure engine-specific behavior for individual requests.
 *
 * @param T The type of the configuration or metadata associated with this capability.
 *
 * Example:
 * Suppose you have a custom capability for WebSocket support that requires a specific configuration:
 * ```kotlin
 * object WebSocketCapability : HttpClientEngineCapability<WebSocketConfig>
 *
 * data class WebSocketConfig(val maxFrameSize: Int, val pingIntervalMillis: Long)
 * ```
 *
 * Setting a capability in a request:
 * ```kotlin
 * client.request {
 *     setCapability(WebSocketCapability, WebSocketConfig(
 *         maxFrameSize = 65536,
 *         pingIntervalMillis = 30000
 *     ))
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Engine Example:
 * A custom engine implementation can declare support for specific capabilities in its `supportedCapabilities` property:
 * ```kotlin
 * override val supportedCapabilities: Set<HttpClientEngineCapability<*>> = setOf(WebSocketCapability)
 * ```
 *
 * Plugin Integration Example:
 * Plugins use capabilities to interact with engine-specific features. For example:
 * ```kotlin
 * if (engine.supportedCapabilities.contains(WebSocketCapability)) {
 *     // Configure WebSocket behavior if supported by the engine
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When creating a custom capability:
 * - Define a singleton object implementing `HttpClientEngineCapability`.
 * - Use the type parameter [T] to provide the associated configuration type or metadata.
 * - Ensure that engines supporting the capability handle the associated configuration properly.
