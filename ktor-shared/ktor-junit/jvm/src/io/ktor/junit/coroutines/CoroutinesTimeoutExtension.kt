/**
 * Coroutines timeout annotation that is similar to JUnit5's [Timeout] annotation. It allows running test methods in a
 * separate thread, failing them after the provided time limit and interrupting the thread.
 *
 * Additionally, it installs [DebugProbes] and dumps all coroutines at the moment of the timeout. It also cancels
 * coroutines on timeout if [cancelOnTimeout] set to `true`. The dump contains the coroutine creation stack traces.
 *
 * This annotation has an effect on test, test factory, test template, and lifecycle methods and test classes that are
 * annotated with it.
 *
 * Annotating a class is the same as annotating every test, test factory, and test template method (but not lifecycle
 * methods) of that class and its inner test classes, unless any of them is annotated with [CoroutinesTimeout], in which
 * case their annotation overrides the one on the containing class.
 *
 * Declaring [CoroutinesTimeout] on a test factory checks that it finishes in the specified time, but does not check
 * whether the methods that it produces obey the timeout as well.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * @CoroutinesTimeout(100)
 * class CoroutinesTimeoutSimpleTest {
 *     // does not time out, as the annotation on the method overrides the class-level one
 *     @CoroutinesTimeout(1000)
 *     @Test
 *     fun classTimeoutIsOverridden() {
 *         runBlocking {
 *             delay(150)
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // times out in 100 ms, timeout value is taken from the class-level annotation
 *     @Test
 *     fun classTimeoutIsUsed() {
 *         runBlocking {
 *             delay(150)
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

 * This JUnit5 extension allows running test, test factory, test template, and lifecycle methods in a separate thread,
 * failing them after the provided time limit and interrupting the thread.
 *
 * Additionally, it installs [DebugProbes] and dumps all coroutines at the moment of the timeout. It also cancels
 * coroutines on timeout if [cancelOnTimeout] set to `true`.
 * [enableCoroutineCreationStackTraces] controls the corresponding [DebugProbes.enableCreationStackTraces] property
 * and can be optionally enabled if the creation stack traces are necessary.
 *
 * Beware that if several tests that use this extension set [enableCoroutineCreationStackTraces] to different values and
 * execute in parallel, the behavior is ill-defined. In order to avoid conflicts between different instances of this
 * extension when using JUnit5 in parallel, use [ResourceLock] with resource name `coroutines timeout` on tests that use
 * it. Note that the tests annotated with [CoroutinesTimeout] already use this [ResourceLock], so there is no need to
 * annotate them additionally.
 *
 * Note that while calls to test factories are verified to finish in the specified time, but the methods that they
 * produce are not affected by this extension.
 *
 * Beware that registering the extension via [CoroutinesTimeout] annotation conflicts with manually registering it on
 * the same tests via other methods (most notably, [RegisterExtension]) and is prohibited.
 *
 * Example of usage:
 * ```
 * class HangingTest {
 *     @JvmField
 *     @RegisterExtension
 *     val timeout = CoroutinesTimeoutExtension.seconds(5)
 *
 *     @Test
 *     fun testThatHangs() = runBlocking {
 *          ...
 *          delay(Long.MAX_VALUE) // somewhere deep in the stack
 *          ...
 *     }

     *   Instead, we know that this extension context will at least outlive this use of this instance, so some debug
     *   probes other than the ones from our constructor are already installed and won't be uninstalled during our
     *   operation. We simply uninstall the debug probes that were installed in our constructor.
     * - If the ownership was passed, but the store is empty, it means that this test instance is reused and, possibly,
     *   the debug probes installed in its constructor were already uninstalled. This means that we have to install them
